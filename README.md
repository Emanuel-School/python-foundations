# Python Foundations

Welcome to the **Python Foundations** repository for Stage 5 Computing Technology. This repo contains all microlabs and macrolabs, organised by module.

## Structure

The repository is structured by topic, following the sequence in the [Game Trek online textbook](https://apolloacademy.gitbook.io/game-trek).

Each topic folder includes:
- **microlab/**: Jupyter notebooks for guided practice
- **macrolab/**: Starter Python files for larger projects

## Student workflow

1. **Clone the repository**
   Use PyCharm or your preferred IDE to clone the repo:

2. **Before each session**
   Always pull the latest changes:
   git pull

3. **Work in your assigned folder**
   Only edit or add files inside the specific topic and task folder you are working on.
   For example, when doing the 1.7 Selection microlab, navigate to:
   /1.7-selection/microlab/

4. **Save and test your work locally**
   Run your code and make sure it works before committing.

5. **Commit your changes**
   Add and commit your files with clear, meaningful messages

6. **Push your work to GitHub**

## Important notes

- **Do not rename or move folders**
  The folder structure is fixed to keep everything organised.
  If you think something should be added or changed, check with the teacher before making changes.

- **Pull updates regularly**
  If you skip pulling updates, you risk creating merge conflicts.

- **Work responsibly**
  Follow ethical coding practices, document your work, and collaborate respectfully.
